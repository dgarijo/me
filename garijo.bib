  abstract = {Public procurement accounts for a 14% of the annual budget of the different governments of the European Union. In Europe, contracting processes are classified using Common Procurement Vocabulary codes (CPVs), a taxonomy designed to facilitate statistical reporting, search and the creation of alerts that can be used by potential bidders. CPVs are commonly assigned manually by public employees in charge of contracting processes. However, CPV classification is not a trivial task, as there are more than 9,000 different CPV categories, which are often assigned following heterogeneous criteria. In this paper we have created a CPV classifier that uses as an input the textual description of the contracting process, and assigns CPVs from the 45 top-level CPV categories. We work only with texts in Spanish, although our approach may be easily extended to other languages. Our results improve the state of the art (10% F1-score improvement) and are available online.},

abstract="The FAIR principles have become a popular means to guide researchers when publishing their research outputs (i.e., data, software, etc.) in a Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable manner. In order to ease compliance with FAIR, different frameworks have been developed by the scientific community, offering guidance and suggestions to researchers. However, scientific outputs are rarely published in isolation. Research Objects have been proposed as a framework to capture the relationships and context of all constituents of an investigation. In this paper we present FAIROs, a framework for assessing the compliance of a Research Object (and its constituents) against the FAIR principles. FAIROs reuses existing FAIR validators for individual resources and proposes i) two scoring methods for assessing the fairness of Research Objects, ii) an initial implementation of the scoring methods in the FAIROs framework, and iii) an explanation-based approach designed to visualize the obtained scores. We validate FAIROs against 165 Research Objects, and discuss the advantages and limitations of different scoring systems.",

As part of the program, awardees were asked to address one of the following "blue sky" questions:•How could/should AI courses incorporate AI Ethics into the curriculum?•How could we teach AI topics at an early undergraduate or a secondary school level?•AI has the potential for broad impact to numerous disciplines. How could we make AI education more interdisciplinary, specifically to benefit non-engineering fields?•How should standard AI courses evolve?•How could we leverage AI education to promote diversity in the field?This paper is a collection of their responses, intended to help motivate discussion around these issues in AI education.},

Software images preserve the computational environment required to execute a scientific experiment and have become a crucial asset for reproducibility. However, software images are usually not properly documented and described, making it challenging for scientists to find, reuse and understand them. In this paper, we propose a framework for automatically describing software images in a machine-readable manner by (i) creating a vocabulary to describe software images; (ii) developing an annotation framework designed to automatically document the underlying environment of software images and (iii) creating DockerPedia, a Knowledge Graph with over 150,000 annotated software images, automatically described using our framework. We illustrate the usefulness of our approach in finding images with specific software dependencies, comparing similar software images, addressing versioning problems when running computational experiments; and flagging problems with vulnerable software dependencies.},

In this paper, we develop a framework to detect and analyze low-quality statements in Wikidata by shedding light on the current practices exercised by the community. We explore three indicators of data quality in Wikidata, based on: (1) community consensus on the currently recorded knowledge, assuming that statements that have been removed and not added back are implicitly agreed to be of low quality; (2) statements that have been deprecated; and (3) constraint violations in the data. We combine these indicators to detect low-quality statements, revealing challenges with duplicate entities, missing triples, violated type rules, and taxonomic distinctions. Our findings complement ongoing efforts by the Wikidata community to improve data quality, aiming to make it easier for users and editors to find and correct mistakes.}

In this paper we provide a systematic review of the state of the art on existing approaches to ease access to ontology-based KG data by application developers. We propose two comparison frameworks to understand specifications, technologies and tools responsible for providing APIs for KGs. Our results reveal several limitations on existing API-based specifications, technologies and tools for KG consumption, which outline exciting research challenges including automatic API generation, API resource path prediction, ontology-based API versioning, and API validation and testing.}

	abstract     = {Due to the increasing uptake of semantic technologies, ontologies are now part of a good number of information systems. As a result, software development teams that have to combine ontology engineering activities with software development practices are facing several challenges, since these two areas have evolved, in general, separately. In this paper we present OnToology, an approach to manage ontology engineering support activities (i.e., documentation, evaluation, releasing and versioning). OnToology is a web-based application that builds on top of Git-based environments and integrates existing semantic web technologies. We have validated OnToology against a set of representative requirements for ontology development support activities in distributed environments, and report on a survey of the system to assess its usefulness and usability.}
